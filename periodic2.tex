\section{Periodic Multipulses}

\subsection{KdV5}

The 5th order KdV equation (KdV5), when written in a moving frame with speed $c$, is given by

\begin{equation}\label{KdV5}
u_t = \partial_x(u_{xxxx} - u_{xx} - u^2 + c)
\end{equation}

We can write this as $u_t = \partial_x E'(u)$, where $E(u)$ is the energy

\begin{equation}\label{energy}
E(u) = -\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{2}u_{xx}^2 + \frac{1}{2}u_x^2 + \frac{1}{2}cu^2 - \frac{1}{3}u^3 \right) dx
\end{equation}

and the operator $\partial_x$ is skew-symmetric. The energy $E(u)$ is conserved (in time) and translation invariant. We also note that $E'(u)$ is reversible, i.e. $E'(u(x)) = 0 \iff E'(u(-x)) = 0$. In particular, this means that $E'(u)$ only involves even order derivatives.\\

An equilibrium solution to \eqref{KdV5} satisfies the 5th order nonlinear ODE

\begin{equation}\label{eqODE}
u_{xxxxx} - u_{xxx} + c u_x - 2 u u_x = 0
\end{equation}

It is clear that $u = 0$ is a solution to \eqref{eqODE}. A primary pulse solution is a homoclinic orbit which connects the equilibrium state $u = 0$ to itself. Since such a solution decays (exponentially) to 0 at both ends, a primary pulse solution must also satisfy the 4th order ODE

\begin{equation}\label{eqODE4}
u_{xxxx} - u_{xx} + c u - u^2 = 0,
\end{equation}

which is obtained from \eqref{eqODE} by integrating once; we take the constant of integration to be 0, since we are seeking a solution which decays to a baseline of 0. Equation \eqref{eqODE4} is also Hamiltonian (in $x$), with energy given by

\begin{equation}\label{Hamiltonian}
H(u, u', u'', u''') = u'u''' - \frac{1}{2}(u'^2) - \frac{1}{2}(u'')^2 + \frac{c}{2}u^2 - \frac{1}{3}u^3 
\end{equation}

The Hamiltonian $H$ is conserved (in $x$).\\

The linearization of the 4th order ODE \eqref{eqODE4} about a solution $u^*(x)$ of \eqref{eqODE4} is the self-adjoint linear operator

\begin{equation}\label{defA0}
A_0(u^*) = \partial_x^4 - \partial_x^2 + c - 2 u^* 
\end{equation}

For the linearization about the rest state $u^* = 0$, the eigenvalues are the solutions to the fourth-order polynomial equation $\nu^4 - \nu^2 + c = 0$, which are

\begin{align}\label{specA0}
\nu = \pm \sqrt{ \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4c} }{2}}
\end{align}

Since two eigenvalues have positive real part and two have negative real part, the equilibrium at 0 is hyperbolic with a two-dimensional stable manifold and a two-dimensional unstable manifold. For $0 < c < 1/4$, all four eigenvalues are real. A bifurcation takes place at $c = 1/4$, and for $c > 1/4$, there is a quartet of eigenvalues of the form $\pm \alpha \pm \beta i$, where $\alpha, \beta > 0$.\\

Using a mountain-pass argument, for $c > 0$, a symmetric homoclinic orbit solution $q(x)$ exists to \eqref{eqODE4}.

\subsection{General Setup}

We will write the problem in general terms, for which KdV5 will be a specific case. Consider the PDE

\begin{equation}\label{genPDE}
u_t = \partial_x E'(u)
\end{equation}

where $u \in \R$, $E'(u): H^{2m}(\R) \subset L^2(\R) \rightarrow L^2(\R)$, and $E(u)$ is the energy of the system (which is conserved in $t$), and $E(0) = 0$. We take $E'(u)$ to be of the form

\[
E'(u) = \partial_x^{2m}u + \tilde{E}(u)
\]

and we make the following hypothesis regarding symmetries of $E'(u)$.

\begin{hypothesis}\label{reversiblehyp}
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $E'(u)$ is reversible, i.e. $E'(u(x)) = 0$ implies $E'(u(-x)) = 0$.
\item $E'(u)$ is translation invariant, i.e. $E'(u(x)) = 0$ implies $E'(u(x + \xi)) = 0$ for all $\xi \in \R$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{hypothesis}

Reversibility implies that the linear part of the operator $E'(u)$ only involves even-order derivatives of $u$ with respect to $x$. The nonlinear part can involve odd-order derivatives with respect to $x$ (e.g. the term $u_x^2$ could occur), but if we take $u(x)$ to be an even function, the nonlinear part must also be an even function in $x$.\\

Equilibrium solutions which decay to a baseline of 0 at $\pm \infty$ satisfy the ODE 

\begin{equation}\label{ODEonR}
E'(u) = \partial_x^{2m}u + \tilde{E}(u) = 0
\end{equation}

Since we are assuming that the highest order derivative $\partial_x^{2m}$ in $E'(u)$ appears only by itself with a coefficient of 1, we can write \eqref{ODEonR} as a first-order system (in the standard way) in $\R^{2m}$ as

\begin{equation}\label{genODE}
U'(x) = F(U(x))
\end{equation}

where $U \in \R^{2m}$, $F: \R^{2m} \rightarrow \R^{2m}$ is smooth, and $F(0) = 0$. For the system written in this way, the reversibility hypothesis implies that

\begin{equation}\label{genODErev}
(RU)'(x) = -F(R(U(x)))
\end{equation}

where $R:\R^{2m} \rightarrow \R^{2m}$ is the standard reversor operator defined by

\begin{equation}\label{reverserR2m}
R(u_1, u_2, \dots, u_{2m-1}, u_{2m}) = (u_1, -u_2, \dots, u_{2m-1}, -u_{2m})
\end{equation}

We begin by looking at the existence problem, which involves solutions to \eqref{genODE}.

\subsection{Existence of Periodic Multipulses}

We take the following hypotheses. First, we assume that \eqref{genODE} is Hamiltonian.

\begin{hypothesis}\label{Hhyp}
There exists a smooth function $H: \R^{2m} \rightarrow \R$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $H(0) = 0$
\item $\nabla H(u) = 0$ if and only if $F(u) = 0$
\item For all $u \in \R^{2m}$,
\begin{equation}
\langle \nabla H(u), F(u) \rangle = 0
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
\end{hypothesis}

It follows from this hypothesis that $H$ is conserved along solutions $U(x)$ to \eqref{genODE}.\\

The next hypothesis addresses the hyperbolicity of the equilibrium of \eqref{genODE} at $U = 0$.  

\begin{hypothesis}\label{hypeq}
0 is a hyperbolic equilibrium of \eqref{genODE}, i.e. $DF(0)$ has no eigenvalues on the imaginary axis. Furthermore, the spectrum of $DF(0)$ contains a quartet of simple eigenvalues $\pm \alpha \pm \beta i$, $\alpha, \beta > 0$. For any other eigenvalue $\nu$ of $DF(0)$, $|\text{Re }\nu| > \alpha$.
\end{hypothesis}

We note that since we have a Hamiltonian system by Hypothesis \ref{Hhyp}, the existence of an eigenvalue $\alpha + \beta i$ implies the existence of the entire quartet $\pm \alpha \pm \beta i$.\\

Let $W^s(0)$ and $W^u(0)$ be the stable and unstable manifolds of the equilibrium at 0. By Hypothesis \ref{Hhyp}, $W^s(0), W^u(0) \subset H^{-1}(0)$, where $H^{-1}(0)$ is the 0-level set of the energy $H$. By reversibility from Hypothesis \ref{reversiblehyp}, $\dim W^s(0) = m$ and $\dim W^u(0) = m$.

In the next hypothesis, we assume that a symmetric homoclinic orbit solution exists to \eqref{genODE}.

\begin{hypothesis}\label{qexistshyp}
A homoclinic orbit solution $Q(x) \in W^s(0) \cap W^u(0) \subset H^{-1}(0)$ exists to \eqref{genODE}. Furthermore, this solution is symmetric with respect to the reverser operator $R$ defined above by \eqref{reverserR2m}, i.e. $Q(-x) = R(Q(x))$.
\end{hypothesis}
 
Since we obtained \eqref{genODE} from putting \eqref{ODEonR} into a first order system in the standard way, $Q(x) = (q(x), q'(x), \dots, q^{(2m)}(x))^T$, where $q(x)$ is a an even function and a solution to \eqref{ODEonR}.\\

Finally, we take a standard nondegeneracy condition regarding the homoclinic orbit $Q(x)$.

\begin{hypothesis}\label{nondegen1}
Let $Q(x)$ be the symmetric homoclinic orbit from Hypothesis \ref{qexistshyp}. We take the non-degeneracy condition
\begin{equation}
T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^u(0) = \R Q'(0)
\end{equation}
\end{hypothesis}

Let $u^*(x)$ be an exponentially localized solution to \eqref{ODEonR}. The linearization of \eqref{ODEonR} about $u^*(x)$ is the eigenvalue problem

\begin{equation}\label{ODEeig}
E''(u^*(x)) v = \lambda v
\end{equation}

where $E''(u^*): H^{2m}(\R) \rightarrow H^{2m}(\R)$ is the Hessian of the energy and is self-adjoint. Since $E'(u)$ is translation invariant, it follows that $E'(u^*(x)) \partial_x u^*(x) = 0$.\\

We can write the eigenvalue problem as the first-order system

\begin{equation}\label{ODEeig2}
V' = ( DF(U^*)V + \lambda B) V 
\end{equation}

where $B$ is the $2m \times 2m$ constant coefficient matrix

\begin{equation}
B = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  & 
\vdots & 0 & \vdots & \\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} 
\end{equation}

and 

\begin{equation}
DF(U^*) = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\
& & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & & \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 1 \\
c_0 + f_0(x) & f_1(x) & c_2 + f_2(x) &
 \dots & c_{2m-2} + f_{2m-2}(x) & f_{2m-1}(x)
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The $c_i$ are constants which do not depend on $u^*$; by Hypothesis \ref{reversiblehyp},no odd-order derivatives are involved in the linear part of $E'(u)$, thus $c_j = 0$ for $j$ odd. The functions $f_i(x)$ decay exponentially to 0 since they are smooth functions of $u^*(x)$ and its derivatives. In addition, if $u^*(x)$ is an even function, $f_i(x)$ is an even function for $i$ even and an odd function for $i$ odd.\\

We make one additional assumption on the constant $c_0$.

\begin{hypothesis}\label{c0nonzero}
For the constant $c_0$ in $DF(U^*)$, $c_0 \neq 0$.
\end{hypothesis}

This hypothesis is satisfied, for example, if \eqref{genPDE} is obtained from putting a nonlinear, dispersive PDE into a moving reference frame with speed $c$. \\

$DF(U^*)$ is exponentially asymptotic to $DF(0)$, which has characteristic polynomial

\begin{equation}\label{charpolyDF0}
p_1(\nu) = \nu^{2m} - c_{2m-2} \nu^{2m-2} - \dots - c_2 \nu^2 - c_0
\end{equation}

By Hypothesis \label{hypeq}, $p_1(\nu)$ has roots at $\nu = \pm \alpha \pm i \beta$, and for all other roots $\nu$ of $p_1(\nu)$ we have $|\text{Re }\nu| > \alpha$.\\

For the variational equation, we take $U^* = Q$ and $\lambda = 0$ in \eqref{ODEeig2}.

\begin{align}
\tilde{V}' = DF(Q(x))\tilde{V} \label{vareq1} \\
\tilde{W}' = -DF(Q(x))^* \tilde{W} \label{adjvareq1}
\end{align}

It follows from Hypothesis \ref{nondegen1} that $Q'(x)$ is the unique bounded solution to \eqref{vareq1} and that there exists a unique bounded solution $\Psi(x)$ to \eqref{adjvareq1}. It follows from Hypothesis \ref{Hhyp} that $\Psi(x) = \nabla H(Q(x))$. Since $E''(q)$ is self-adjoint, it is not hard to show that the $2m$-th component of $\Psi(x)$ is $q'(x)$.\\

% Finally, we decompose the tangent space at $Q(0)$ as 

% \begin{equation}
% \R^{2m} = \R \Psi(0) \oplus \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \oplus Y^-
% \end{equation}

% where

% \begin{align*}
% T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) &= \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \\
% T_{Q(0)}W^u(0) &= \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^- \\
% \end{align*}

% and $\Psi(0) \perp \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \oplus Y^-$.\\

We can now state the existence theorem for periodic multi-pulse solutions. A$n-$periodic solution to \eqref{genODE} is a periodic orbit $Q_{np}(x)$ which resembles $n$ copies of the primary pulse solution $Q(x)$. We will describe an $n-$periodic solution by $n$ lengths $X_0, \dots, X_{n-1}$, where the $n-1$ distances between the $n$ peaks are $2X_0, \dots 2X_{n_2}$, and $X_{n-1}$ is the distance from the left- and rightmost peaks to the periodic boundary.

\begin{theorem}[Existence of $n$-periodic solutions]\label{perexist}
Assume Hypotheses \ref{hypeq} and \ref{Hhyp}, and let $Q(x)$ be a transversely constructed primary pulse solution to \eqref{genODE}, according to Hypothesis \ref{nondegen1}.\\

Then there exists an a nonnegative integer $M$ and $K > 0$ such that the following holds. For any 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item integer $n \geq 2$ \\
\item integer $m \geq M$ \\
\item sequence of nonnegative integers $\{ m_0, \dots, m_{n-2} \}$, where at least one of them must be 0
\end{enumerate}

there exists a 1-parameter family of $n$-periodic solutions to \eqref{genODE} associated with $m$ and the set $\{ m_j \}$. This 1-parameter family is parameterized by the length $X_{n-1} \in [K, \infty)$.\\

The lengths $X_0, \dots, X_{n-2}$ are given by

\begin{equation}\label{Xi}
X_i = \frac{\pi}{2 \beta}m 
- \frac{1}{2 \alpha} \log(a_i(X_{n-1}, r_m)) + C
\end{equation}

where $C$ is a constant, $r_m = e^{-m \pi \alpha/\beta}$, and $a_i(X_{n-1}, r_m) \rightarrow e^{-m_i \pi \alpha/ \beta}$ as $(X_{n-1}, r_m) \rightarrow (\infty, 0)$. For large $X_{n-1}$ and $m$, the lengths $X_0, \dots, X_{n-2}$ are approximately

\begin{equation}\label{Xiapprox}
X_i = \frac{\pi}{2 \beta}(m + m_i) + C
\end{equation}

If $U(x)$ is such a solution, then $U(x)$ can be written piecewise for $i = 0, \dots, n-1$ as 

\begin{align}
U_i^-(x) &= Q^-(x; \beta_i^-) + V_i^-(x) && x \in [X_{i-1}, 0] \\
U_i^+(x) &= Q^+(x; \beta_i^+) + V_i^+(x) && x \in [0, X_i]
\end{align}

where the subscripts $i$ are taken $\mod n$. The functions $Q^\pm(x; \beta_i^\pm)$ are solutions to \eqref{genODE} with initial conditions $\beta_i^\pm$ in the stable/unstable manifold. For these terms, we have bounds

\begin{align*}
|Q^\pm(x; \beta_i^\pm)| \leq C (e^{-2 \alpha X_{i-1}} + e^{-2 \alpha X_i})e^{-\alpha |x|}
\end{align*} 

The remainder terms $V_i^\pm(x)$ have bounds

\begin{align}
|V_i^-(x)| &\leq C e^{-\alpha(X_{i-1} + x)}e^{-\alpha X_{i-1}} \\
|V_i^+(x)| &\leq C e^{-\alpha(X_i - x)}e^{-\alpha X_i} 
\end{align} 
\end{theorem}

For the family of $2-$periodic solutions, we have actually have found the complete bifurcation structure, which we can add here.

\subsection{Stability Problem}

Now that have shown existence of periodic multi-pulse solutions, we will now look at their stability. For linear stability, this involves finding the eigenvalues of \eqref{genPDE}. Let $u^*(x)$ be any exponentially localized equilibrium solution to \eqref{genPDE}. Substituting the standard linearization ansatz $u(x, t) = u^*(x) + \epsilon e^{\lambda t}v(x)$ into \eqref{genPDE} and keeping terms of order $\epsilon$, we obtain the PDE eigenvalue problem

\begin{equation}\label{PDEeig}
\partial_x E''(u^*(x)) v = \lambda v
\end{equation}

which is just \eqref{ODEeig} with a $\partial_x$ out front. From above, we have $[\partial_x E''(u^*(x))] \partial_x u^*(x) = 0$. Letting $U^*(x) = (u^*(x), \partial_x u^*(x), \dots, \partial_x^{2m}u^*(x))$, we can write \eqref{PDEeig} as the first order system 

\begin{equation}\label{PDEeig2}
V' = ( A(U^*)V + \lambda B)V 
\end{equation}

where $A(U^*)$ is the $(2m+1) \times (2m+1)$ matrix

\begin{equation}\label{DefA}
A(U^*) = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\
& & \ddots  \\
0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 1 \\
f_0'(x) & c_0 + f_0(x) + f_1'(x) & \dots & c_{2m-2} + f_{2m-2}(x) + f_{2m-1}' (x) & f_{2m-1}(x)
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

and $B$ is the $(2m +1) \times (2m+1)$ constant coefficient matrix

\begin{equation}\label{DefB}
B = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  & 
\vdots & & \vdots & \\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} 
\end{equation}

(We keep the notation $B$ for the matrix since it has exactly the same form as the matrix $B$ in the previous section.) The terms $c_i$ and $f_i(x)$ in the bottom row of $A(U^*)$ are the same as in those in the bottom row of $DF(U^*)$ from the previous section. Since $u^*(x)$ is exponentially localized, $A(U^*)$ is exponentially asymptotic to $A(0)$, which has characteristic polynomial

\begin{equation}\label{charpolyDF0}
p_2(\nu) = -\nu^{2m+1} + c_{2m-2} \nu^{2m-1} + \dots + c_2 \nu^3 - c_0 \nu = \nu p_1(\nu)
\end{equation}

where $p_1(\nu)$ is the characteristic polynomial of $DF(0)$ from the previous section. Thus $A(0)$ has a simple eigenvalue at 0, and the rest of the eigenvalues of $A(0)$ are the same as those of $DF(0)$. Using Hypothesis \ref{hypeq}, it follows that the spectrum of $A(0)$ contains $\{ 0, \pm \alpha \pm \beta i\}$, and for any other eigenvalue $\nu$ of $A(0)$, $|\text{Re }|\nu| > \alpha$. Since $A(0)$ is not hyperbolic, the results of San98 do not apply.\\

Let $W^s(0)$, $W^u(0)$, and $W^c(0)$ be the stable, unstable, and center manifolds of the equilibrium at 0. By reversibility from Hypothesis \ref{reversiblehyp}, $\dim W^s(0) = m$ and $\dim W^u(0) = m$. The center manifold $W^c(0)$ is one-dimensional.\\

Let $Q(x) = (q(x), \partial_x q(x), \dots, \partial_x^{2m} q(x))$, where $q(x)$ is the symmetric primary pulse solution from Hypothesis \ref{qexistshyp}.\\

For the variational and adjoint variational equations, we take $U^* = Q$ and $\lambda = 0$ in \eqref{PDEeig2} to get

\begin{align}
V' = A(Q) V \label{vareq2} \\
W' = -A(Q)^* W \label{adjvareq2}
\end{align}

$Q'(x)$ is an exponentially localized solution to \eqref{vareq2}. Since $Q(x)$ is exponentially localized, it cannot involve the center manifold $W^c(0)$, thus it must lie in the intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds. In particular, this implies that $\R Q'(0) \subset T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^u(0)$. From Hypothesis \ref{nondegen1}, these are actually equal, which we state in the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{nondegenlemma}
We have the nondegeneracy condition

\begin{equation}\label{nondegen2}
T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^u(0) = \R Q'(0)
\end{equation}

\begin{proof}
Since $Q(x)$ is a homoclinic orbit in the intersection of $W^u(0)$ and $W^s(0)$, $\R Q'(0) \subset T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^u(0)$. If the intersection were more than one-dimensional, there would exist another exponentially localized solution $V(x) = (v_1, \dots, v_{2m}, v_{2m+1})^T$ to \eqref{vareq2}. It follows that $\tilde{V}(x) = (v_1, \dots, v_{2m})^T$ would be an exponentially localized solution to \eqref{vareq1}, which contradicts Hypothesis \ref{nondegen1}.
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

Using the nondegeneracy condition, we can decompose the tangent spaces of the stable and unstable manifolds at $Q(0)$ as

\begin{align*}
T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) &= \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \\
T_{Q(0)}W^u(0) &= \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^- \\
\end{align*}

Let $V_0$ and $W_0$ be the eigenvectors of $A(Q)$ and $-A^*(Q)$ corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. From \eqref{DefA}, we can see that

\begin{align}
V_0 &= (-1/c_0, 0, 0, \dots, 0)^T \label{V0} \\
W_0 &= (-c_0, 0, -c_2, 0, -c_4, 0, \dots, 0, -c_{2m-2}, 0, 1)^T \label{W0}
\end{align}

where we have scaled $V_0$ so that $\langle V_0, W_0 \rangle = 1$. We have the following lemma regarding solutions to \eqref{vareq2} and \eqref{adjvareq2}.

\begin{lemma}\label{varadjsolutions}
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]

\item There exists exactly two linearly independent, bounded solutions $\Psi(x)$ and $\Psi^c(x)$ to \eqref{adjvareq2}. $\Psi(x)$ is exponentially localized, i.e. $e^{\alpha |x|}\Psi(x)$ is bounded. For $\Psi^c(x)$,
	\begin{equation}
	\Psi^c(x) \rightarrow W_0 \text{ as }|x| \rightarrow \infty
	\end{equation}

\item There exists a bounded solution $V_0(x)$ of \eqref{vareq2} such that 
\begin{equation}
V_0(x) \rightarrow V_0 \text{ as }|x| \rightarrow \infty
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The adjoint variational equation \eqref{adjvareq2} is the following equation written as a first order system
\begin{equation}\label{adj2}
[\partial_x E''(q) ]^* v(x) = -E''(q) \partial_x v(x) = 0,
\end{equation}
which has exponentially decaying solution $q(x)$. Thus we have an exponentially localized solution $\Psi(x)$ to \eqref{adjvareq2} which has $q(x)$ as its $(m+1)$-th component. Since $q(x)$ is an even function, the functions $f_j(x)$ from \eqref{DefA} are even for $j$ even and odd for $j$ odd. Thus, from the form of $A(Q)$, $\Psi(-x) = R \Psi(x)$, where $R$ is the standard reversor operator.

\item Equation \eqref{adj2} also has the constant solution 1 as a solution. Thus \eqref{adjvareq2} has a solution $\Psi^c(x)$ which has $1$ as its $(m+1)$-th component. This solution has the form

\[
\Psi^c(x) = \begin{pmatrix}
-c_0 + g_1(x) \\ g_2(x) \\
-c_2 + g_3(x) \\ g_4(x) \\
\vdots \\
-c_{2m-2} + g_{2m-1}(x) \\ g_{2m}(x) \\ 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

where the functions $g_j(x)$ are linear combinations of the functions $f_j(x)$ from \eqref{DefA} and their derivatives and are thus exponentially localized. Thus we see that $\Psi^c(x) \rightarrow W_0$ as $|x| \rightarrow \infty$, where $W_0$ is given by \eqref{W0}.

\item Any bounded solution to \eqref{adjvareq2} must be perpendicular to $\R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \oplus Y^-$, which is a $(2m-1)-$dimensional subspace of $\R^{2m+1}$. We have found two linearly independent, bounded solutions \eqref{adjvareq2}, thus there can be no others.

\item Recall that $\dim W^{s/u}(0) = m$ and $\dim W^c(0) = 1$, thus $\dim W^{cs}(0) = m + 1$, and $\dim W^{cu}(0) = m + 1$. $\Psi(0) \perp T_{Q(0)}W^{cs}(0) + T_{Q(0)}W^{cu}(0)$, so $\dim T_{Q(0)}W^{cs}(0) + T_{Q(0)}W^{cu}(0) \leq 2m$. This implies, by a dimension-counting argument, that $\dim T_{Q(0)}W^{cs}(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^{cu}(0) = 2$. Since $\dim T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) = 1$ by Lemma \ref{nondegenlemma}, we conclude that there exists $Y_0 \in T_{Q(0)}W^{cs}(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^{cu}(0)$ which is linearly independent from $Q'(0)$ and for $Y^0 \notin T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^s(0)$.

\item Using $Y_0$ as the initial condition for the variational equation \eqref{vareq2} gives us the bounded solution $V_0(x)$ in (i). For the decay to $V_0$, we might need the gap lemma (which gives this on $\R^\pm$ separately) and the symmetry of the problem.

\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

Using Lemma \ref{nondegenlemma} and Lemma \ref{varadjsolutions}, we can decompose the tangent space at $Q(0)$ as 

\begin{equation}
\R^{2m+1} = S \oplus \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \oplus Y^-
\end{equation}

where $S = \spn\{ \Psi(0), \Psi^c(0) \}$, and $S \perp \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \oplus Y^-$.

Finally, we will look at the Melnikov integrals relevant to the problem. For the lowest order Melnikov integral, we have

\begin{equation}\label{M1}
M_1 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \langle \Psi(x), B Q'(x) \rangle =
\int_{-\infty}^\infty q(x) \: \partial_x q(x) = 0
\end{equation}

since $q(x)$ is an even function and the last component of $\Psi(x)$ is $q(x)$. Recall that 

\[
\ker [\partial_x E''(q)]^* = \ker(-E''(q) \partial_x) = 
\text{span}\{ q, 1 \}
\]

Since $\langle \partial_x q, q \rangle = 0$ (from above) and $\langle \partial_x q, 1 \rangle = 0$ (since $q$ is an even function), $q \perp \ker [\partial_x E''(q)]^*$. Thus, by the Fredholm alternative, there exists a function $t(x) \in H^{2m}(\R)$ such that $[ \partial_x E''(q) ]t(x) = \partial_x q(x)$. Let $T(x) = (t(x), \partial_x t(x), \dots, \partial_x^{2m}(x))^T$. Then $T(x)$ solves the equation

\begin{equation}\label{eqforT}
T' = A(Q)T + B Q'
\end{equation}

We take the following hypothesis regarding the higher order Melnikov integral.

\begin{hypothesis}\label{Melnikov2hyp}
We have the following Melnikov-like expression
\begin{equation}\label{M2}
M_2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \langle \Psi(x), B T(x) \rangle dx =
\int_{-\infty}^\infty q(x) t(x) dx \neq 0
\end{equation}
\end{hypothesis}

To find the eigenvalues of \eqref{PDEeig}, we use Lin's method to construct an eigenfunction as a perturbation of a piecewise linear combination of $Q'(x)$ and $T(x)$. Let $q_{np}(x)$ be a periodic $n-$pulse solution constructed with lengths $X_0, \dots, X_{n-1}$ from a symmetric primary pulse $q(x)$ as in the previous section. We take an ansatz of the form 

\begin{align*}
V_i^-(x) = d_i (Q'(x) + \lambda T(x)) + W_i^-(x) && x \in [-X_{i-1}, 0] \\
V_i^-(x) = d_i (Q'(x) + \lambda T(x)) + W_i^-(x) && x \in [x, X_i]
\end{align*}

for $i = 0, \dots, n-1$. For $X_m = \min\{X_0, \dots, X_{n-1} \}$ sufficiently large and $\lambda$ sufficiently small, Lin's method constructs an unique function of this form which solves \eqref{PDEeig}. This function is continuous except for $n$ jumps, so it is only an eigenfunction if all of these jumps are 0. Lin's method gives a formula for those jump conditions; finding the eigenvalues $\lambda$ then amounts to solving the $n$ jump conditions.\\

In order to set up the problem, we rewrite the PDE eigenvalue problem of interest as

\begin{equation}\label{PDEeig3}
V' = A(U^*(x); \lambda)V 
\end{equation} 

where $A(U^*(x); \lambda) = A(U^*) + \lambda B$. For $\lambda = 0$, the asymptotic matrix $A(0; 0)$ has a eigenvalue at 0. By Hypothesis \ref{hypeq}, this eigenvalue at 0 is simple and located a distance $\sqrt{\alpha^2 + \beta^2}$ from the nearest other eigenvalues. Using the IFT and Hypothesis \ref{c0nonzero}, for sufficiently small $\lambda$, $A(0; \lambda)$ has a simple eigenvalue $\nu(\lambda)$ near 0. By the IFT and reversibility, this eigenvalue is given by

\begin{equation}\label{nulambda}
\nu(\lambda) = -\frac{1}{c_0} \lambda + \mathcal{O}(|\lambda|^3)
\end{equation}

and has following properties

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\nu(-\lambda) = -\nu(\lambda)$, i.e. $\nu(\lambda)$ is an odd function 
\item If $\lambda$ is pure imaginary, $\nu(\lambda)$ is also pure imaginary
\end{enumerate}

We can now state the stability theorem for periodic multi-pulse solutions. 

\begin{theorem}\label{blockmatrixtheorem}
There exists a $\delta > 0$ with the following property. Let $q_{np}(x)$ be a periodic $n-$pulse solution constructed with lengths $X_0, \dots, X_{n-1}$ according to Theorem \ref{perexist}, where $X_m = \min\{ X_0, \dots X_{n-1}\}$ and $e^{-\alpha X_m} < \delta$. Then there exists a bounded, nonzero solution $V$ of \eqref{PDEeig} for $|\lambda| < \delta$ if and only if 

\begin{equation}\label{blockeq}
E(\lambda) = \det
\begin{pmatrix}
K(\lambda) + C_1 K(\lambda) + K_1(\lambda) & D_1 \\
C_2 K(\lambda) + K_2(\lambda) & A - \lambda^2 MI + D_2
\end{pmatrix} = 0
\end{equation}

where 

\begin{enumerate}

\item The matrix $K(\lambda)$ is given by

\begin{equation}
K(\lambda) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{-\nu(\lambda)X_1} & & & & & -e^{\nu(\lambda)X_0} \\
-e^{\nu(\lambda)X_1} & e^{-\nu(\lambda)X_2} \\
& -e^{\nu(\lambda)X_2} & e^{-\nu(\lambda)X_3} \\
\vdots & & \vdots & &&  \vdots \\
& & & & -e^{\nu(\lambda)X_{n-1}} & e^{-\nu(\lambda)X_0} 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

where $\nu(\lambda)$ is the small eigenvalue of the asymptotic matrix $A(0; \lambda)$ defined in \eqref{nulambda}.

\item $A$ is the symmetric matrix

\begin{align}\label{Asymm}
A &= \begin{pmatrix}
-a_0 -a_1 & a_0 + a_1 \\
a_0 + a_1 & -a_0 - a_1
\end{pmatrix} && n = 2 \\
A &= \begin{pmatrix}
-a_{n-1} - a_0 & a_0 & & & \dots & a_{n-1}\\
a_0 & -a_0 - a_1 &  a_1 \\
& a_1 & -a_1 - a_2 &  a_2 \\
& & \vdots & & \vdots \\
a_{n-1} & & & & a_{n-2} & -a_{n-2} - a_{n-1} \\
\end{pmatrix} && n > 2 \nonumber
\end{align}

where

\begin{align*}
a_i &= \langle \Psi(X_i), Q'(-X_i) \rangle \\
\end{align*}

$\Psi(x)$ is the exponentially localized solution to the adjoint variational equation \eqref{adjvareq2} defined in Lemma \ref{varadjsolutions}. $Q(x) = (q(x), \partial_x q(x), \dots, \partial_x^{2m}q(x))$, where $q(x)$ is the symmetric primary pulse solution from Hypothesis \ref{qexistshyp}.\\

\item $K_1(\lambda)$ and $K_2(\lambda)$ are small perturbations of $K(\lambda)$, where the nonzero terms of $K(\lambda)$ are perturbed by $\mathcal{O}(|\lambda| + e^{-\alpha X_m})$.

\item The remainder terms are analytic in $\lambda$ and have uniform bounds

\begin{align*}
C_1, C_2 &= \mathcal{O}(e^{-\tilde{\alpha}X_m})(|\lambda| + e^{-\alpha X_m})) \\
D_1 &= \mathcal{O}((|\lambda| + e^{-\tilde{\alpha} X_m})(|\lambda| + e^{-\alpha X_m})) \\
D_2 &= \mathcal{O}((|\lambda| + e^{-\tilde{\alpha} X_m})(|\lambda| + e^{-\alpha X_m})^2)
\end{align*}

\item $M$ is the higher order Melnikov integral

\begin{align*}
M &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty \Psi(y) t(y) dy \\
\end{align*}

where $t(y)$ is the generalized kernel eigenfunction for $\partial_x E''(q)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

We can use this theorem to solve for the eigenvalues $\lambda$ of \eqref{PDEeig}. In order to do that, we need to make a few additional hypotheses.

First, we note that the matrix $A$ from Theorem \ref{blockmatrixtheorem} is symmetric, thus its eigenvalues are real. $A$ has an eigenvalues of 0 corresponding to eigenvector $(1, 1, \dots, 1)^T$. We will hypothesize that the eigenvalues of $A$ distinct. 

\begin{hypothesis}\label{eigAdistinct}
The eigenvalues of $A$ are given by $(0, \mu_1, \dots, \mu_{n-1})$, all of which are distinct.
\end{hypothesis}

This is not true in general. For example, if $n \geq 3$ and all the terms $a_i$ in $A$ are identical, $A$ is a circulant matrix and it is not hard to show that $A$ will have eigenvalues of algebraic multiplicity 2. It might be possible to impose a condition that guarantees distinct eigenvalues. If so, we will hypothesize that instead. Since the problem $(A - \lambda I)v = 0$ is a Sturm-Liouville difference equation, that's a good place to look for such a result.\\

Before we continue, we note the following. Let $X = X_0 + X_1 + \dots + X_{n-1}$, which is half the length of the domain.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The matrix $A - \lambda^2 M I$ is singular at $\lambda = 0$ (algebraic multiplicity 2) and at the $2n-2$ points $\lambda = \pm \sqrt{\mu_1/M}, \dots, \pm \sqrt{\mu_{n-1}/M}$.

	\item The matrix $K(\lambda)$ is singular at $\lambda = \pm \lambda(X,k)$, where
	\begin{align}\label{lambdaXk}
	\lambda(X,k)
		&= -c_0 \frac{k \pi i }{X} + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{k}{X}\right)^2 
	\end{align} 
	and $\lambda(X, 0) = 0$.
\end{enumerate}  

For the nonzero eigenvalues, we expect to have $2m-2$ interaction eigenvalues, which occur near $\lambda = \pm \sqrt{\mu_1/M}$, as well as pairs of ``essential spectrum'' eigenvalues, which occur near $\lambda = \pm c_0 \frac{k \pi i }{X}$. For the analysis to work, we need to ensure that these singular points do not get too close. We take the following hypothesis.

\begin{hypothesis}\label{epsilonballs}
Each of the $2n - 2$ points $\sqrt{\mu_k/M}$ (for $k = 1, \dots, n-1$) is located at least a distance $\epsilon/X$ from all of the points $\lambda(X,k)$ (for $k \in \Z$), where $\epsilon$ will be specified later.
\end{hypothesis}

We can now state locate and count the eigenvalues.

\begin{theorem}
Let $\delta > 0$ be defined as in Theorem \ref{blockmatrixtheorem}. Then we have the following results.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]

\item There is an eigenvalue at 0 with algebraic multiplicity 2. The kernel eigenfunction is $\partial_x q(x)$, and the generalized kernel eigenfunction is $t(x)$.

\item In Hypothesis \ref{epsilonballs}, choose $\epsilon = e^{-\alpha X_m/2}$.
Then, for sufficiently large $X_m$, there are $2n-2$ nonzero interaction eigenvalues which come in pairs and are either real or purely imaginary. These interaction eigenvalues are given by $\lambda = \pm \lambda^i(X_m; k)$, $k = 1, \dots, n-1$, where

\begin{equation}\label{inteigs}
\lambda^i(X_m; k) = \sqrt{\mu_k / M} + \mathcal{O}(e^{-3 \alpha X_m/2})
\end{equation}

The remainder term cannot move these off of the real or imaginary axis. 

\item For a radius $\tilde{\delta}$ which may be slightly smaller than $\delta$, for sufficiently large $X_m$ there are exactly $2n + 2k + 1$ eigenvalues inside $B(0, \tilde{\delta}) \subset \C$, where $n$ is the number of pulses in the multi-pulse, and $k$ is a positive integer depending on $X$.

\item In Hypothesis \ref{epsilonballs}, choose $\epsilon = e^{-\alpha X_m/(n+1)}$, where $n$ is the number of pulses in the multi-pulse. (This is a larger $\epsilon$ than in part (i)). In addition, assume that $X \leq C e^{\alpha X_m}$, where the constant $C$ is at most $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Then for any positive integer $k$ such that $k/X$ is sufficiently small, there is a pair of purely imaginary ``essential spectrum'' eigenvalues. These are given by $\lambda = \pm \lambda^c(X_m; X, k)$, where

\begin{equation}\label{essspeceigs}
\lambda^c(X_m; X, k) = -c_0 \frac{k \pi i}{X} + \mathcal{O}\left( \frac{1}{X_m} \frac{k}{X} \right)
\end{equation}

The remainder term cannot move these off of the imaginary axis.\\

\item Take the same assumptions as in part (iii). Then there is an additional eigenvalue at 0. In addition, there are no eigenvalues inside $B(0, \tilde{\delta}) \subset \C$ other than those which have already been discussed, where $\tilde{\delta}$ is the same as in part (ii).

\end{enumerate}

\end{theorem}

% \subsection{KdV5}

% For KdV5, a primary pulse solution is known to exist (Chug2007, among others), so Hypothesis \ref{transverseQ} is satisfied. For $c > 1/4$, Hypothesis \ref{hypeq} is satisfied. Finally, for KdV5, \eqref{genODE} is Hamiltonian, so Hypothesis \ref{Hhyp} is satisfied. Thus, Theorem \ref{perexist} holds, and $n-$periodic solutions exist.\\

% We assume Hypothesis \ref{nondegen} holds for KdV5. The adjoint variational equation has two solutions, $\Psi(x)$ and $\Psi^c(x)$, which are given by

% \begin{equation}\label{KdV5psi}
% \Psi(x) = \begin{pmatrix}
% q^{(4)}(x) - q''(x) + (-2q(x) + c)q(x)\\
% -q^{(3)}(x) + q'(x) \\
% q''(x) - q(x) \\
% -q'(x) \\
% q(x)
% \end{pmatrix}
% \end{equation}

% and

% \begin{align}\label{KdV5psic}
% \Psi^c(x) = (c - 2 q(x), 0, -1, 0, 1)^T
% \end{align}

% where $q(x)$ is the primary pulse solution (as a real-valued function). These satisfy Hypothesis \ref{adjsolutions}. Finally, the Melnikov integrals are given by

% \begin{align*}
% M_1 &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty q(x) q'(x) dx = 0 \\
% M_2 &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty q(x) q_c(x) dx \\
% M^c &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty q_c(x) dx
% \end{align*}

% We assume that $M_2 \neq 0$, which is suggested by numerics. $M^c$ does not matter, although numerics suggests that it is also nonzero.\\

% In Theorem \ref{PDEeigtheorem}, for KdV5 we have $\tilde{a}_i = a_i$, since the primary pulse $q(x)$ is an even function. Thus the matrix $A$ in \ref{PDEeigtheorem} is given by

% \begin{align*}
% A &= \begin{pmatrix}
% -a_0 -a_1 & a_0 + a_1 \\
% a_0 + a_1 & -a_0 - a_1
% \end{pmatrix} && n = 2 \\
% A &= \begin{pmatrix}
% -a_{n-1} - a_0 & a_0 & & & \dots & a_{n-1}\\
% a_0 & -a_0 - a_1 &  a_1 \\
% & a_1 & -a_1 - a_2 &  a_2 \\
% & & \vdots & & \vdots \\
% a_{n-1} & & & & a_{n-2} & -a_{n-2} - a_{n-1} \\
% \end{pmatrix} && n > 2
% \end{align*}
