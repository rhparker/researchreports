\section{Periodic Multipulses}

\subsection{KdV5}

The 5th order KdV equation (KdV5), when written in a moving frame with speed $c$, is

\begin{equation}\label{KdV5}
u_t = \partial_x(u_{xxxx} - u_{xx} - u^2 + c)
\end{equation}

We can write this as $u_t = \partial_x E'(u)$, where $E(u)$ is the energy

\begin{equation}\label{energy}
E(u) = -\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{2}u_{xx}^2 + \frac{1}{2}u_x^2 + \frac{1}{2}cu^2 - \frac{1}{3}u^3 \right) dx
\end{equation}

The energy $E(u)$ is conserved (in time) and is translation invariant. We also note that $E'(u)$ is reversible. In particular, this means that the linear part of $E'(u)$ only involves even order derivatives.\\

An equilibrium solution to \eqref{KdV5} satisfies the 5th order nonlinear ODE

\begin{equation}\label{eqODE}
u_{xxxxx} - u_{xxx} + c u_x - 2 u u_x = 0
\end{equation}

It is clear that $u = 0$ is a solution to \eqref{eqODE}. A primary pulse solution is a homoclinic orbit which connects the equilibrium state $u = 0$ to itself. A primary pulse solution must also satisfy the 4th order ODE

\begin{equation}\label{eqODE4}
u_{xxxx} - u_{xx} + c u - u^2 = 0,
\end{equation}

which is obtained from \eqref{eqODE} by integrating once; we take the constant of integration to be 0, since we are seeking a solution which decays to 0. Equation \eqref{eqODE4} is Hamiltonian, with energy given by

\begin{equation}\label{Hamiltonian}
H(u, u', u'', u''') = u'u''' - \frac{1}{2}(u'^2) - \frac{1}{2}(u'')^2 + \frac{c}{2}u^2 - \frac{1}{3}u^3 
\end{equation}

The Hamiltonian $H$ is conserved (in $x$).\\

The linearization of the 4th order ODE \eqref{eqODE4} about a solution $u^*(x)$ of \eqref{eqODE4} is the self-adjoint linear operator

\begin{equation}\label{defA0}
A_0(u^*) = E''(u^*) = \partial_x^4 - \partial_x^2 + c - 2 u^* 
\end{equation}

For the linearization about the rest state $u^* = 0$, the eigenvalues are the solutions to the fourth-order polynomial equation $\nu^4 - \nu^2 + c = 0$, which are

\begin{align}\label{specA0}
\nu = \pm \sqrt{ \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4c} }{2}}
\end{align}

Since two eigenvalues have positive real part and two have negative real part, the equilibrium at 0 is hyperbolic with a two-dimensional stable manifold and a two-dimensional unstable manifold. For $0 < c < 1/4$, all four eigenvalues are real. A bifurcation takes place at $c = 1/4$, and for $c > 1/4$, there is a quartet of eigenvalues of the form $\pm \alpha \pm \beta i$, where $\alpha, \beta > 0$.\\

Using a mountain-pass argument (Chug2007), we can show that a symmetric homoclinic orbit solution $q(x)$ exists to \eqref{eqODE4} for $c > 0$.

\subsection{General Setup}

We will write the problem in general terms, for which KdV5 will be a specific case. Consider the PDE

\begin{equation}\label{genPDE}
u_t = \partial_x E'(u)
\end{equation}

where $u \in H^{2m}(\R)$ and $E'(u): H^{2m}(\R) \subset L^2(\R) \rightarrow L^2(\R)$. $E(u)$ is the energy of the system (which is conserved in $t$), and $E(0) = 0$.\\

We take the following hypothesis regarding $E'(u)$.

\begin{hypothesis}\label{Eprimehyp}
The operator $E'(u)$ has the following properties
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $E'(u)$ is of the form
\begin{equation}\label{Eprimeuform}
E'(u) = \partial_x^{2m}u + \tilde{E}(u)
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{E}(u)$ involves only derivatives of order $2m-1$ and lower.
\item $E'(u)$ is reversible, i.e. $E'(u) = 0$ implies $E'(\rho(u)) = 0$,
where $[\rho(u)](x) = u(-x)$.
\item $E'(u)$ is translation invariant, i.e. $E'(u) = 0$ implies $E'(\tau_\xi(u)) = 0$ for all $\xi \in \R$, where $[\tau_\xi(u)](x) = u(x - \xi)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{hypothesis}

Reversibility implies that the linear part of the operator $E'(u)$ only involves even-order derivatives of $u$ with respect to $x$. The nonlinear part can involve odd-order derivatives with respect to $x$ (e.g. the term $u_x^2$ could occur), but if we take $u(x)$ to be an even function, the nonlinear part must also be an even function in $x$.\\

Equilibrium solutions which decay to 0 at $\pm \infty$ satisfy the ODE 

\begin{equation}\label{ODEonR}
E'(u) = \partial_x^{2m}u + \tilde{E}(u) = 0
\end{equation}

Since, by Hypothesis \ref{Eprimehyp}, the highest order derivative $\partial_x^{2m}$ in $E'(u)$ only appears by itself with a coefficient of 1, we can write \eqref{ODEonR} as a first-order system in the standard way as

\begin{equation}\label{genODE}
U'(x) = F(U(x))
\end{equation}

where $U = (u, \partial_x u, \dots, \partial_x^{2m-1} u) \in \R^{2m}$, $F: \R^{2m} \rightarrow \R^{2m}$ is smooth, and $F(0) = 0$. For the system \eqref{genODE}, the reversibility hypothesis implies that

\begin{equation}\label{genODErev}
(RU)'(x) = -F(R(U(x)))
\end{equation}

where $R:\R^{2m} \rightarrow \R^{2m}$ is the standard reversor operator defined by

\begin{equation}\label{reverserR2m}
R(u_1, u_2, \dots, u_{2m-1}, u_{2m}) = (u_1, -u_2, \dots, u_{2m-1}, -u_{2m})
\end{equation}

We begin by looking at the existence problem, which involves solutions to \eqref{genODE}.

\subsection{Existence of Periodic Multi-pulses}

In order to prove the existence of periodic multi-pulse solutions to \eqref{genODE}, we take the following hypotheses. First, we assume that \eqref{genODE} is Hamiltonian.

\begin{hypothesis}\label{Hhyp}
There exists a smooth function $H: \R^{2m} \rightarrow \R$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $H(0) = 0$
\item $\nabla H(u) = 0$ if and only if $F(u) = 0$
\item For all $u \in \R^{2m}$,
\begin{equation}
\langle \nabla H(u), F(u) \rangle = 0
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
\end{hypothesis}

It follows from this hypothesis that $H$ is conserved along solutions $U(x)$ to \eqref{genODE}.\\

The next hypothesis addresses the hyperbolicity of the equilibrium of \eqref{genODE} at $U = 0$.  

\begin{hypothesis}\label{hypeqhyp}
$U = 0$ is a hyperbolic equilibrium of \eqref{genODE}, i.e. $DF(0)$ has no eigenvalues on the imaginary axis. Furthermore, the spectrum of $DF(0)$ contains a quartet of simple eigenvalues $\pm \alpha \pm \beta i$, $\alpha, \beta > 0$, and for any other eigenvalue $\nu$ of $DF(0)$, $|\text{Re }\nu| > \alpha$.
\end{hypothesis}

We note that since we have a Hamiltonian system by Hypothesis \ref{Hhyp}, the existence of an eigenvalue $\alpha + \beta i$ implies the existence of the entire quartet $\pm \alpha \pm \beta i$.\\

Let $W^s(0)$ and $W^u(0)$ be the stable and unstable manifolds of the equilibrium at 0. By Hypothesis \ref{Hhyp}, $W^s(0), W^u(0) \subset H^{-1}(0)$, where $H^{-1}(0)$ is the 0-level set of the energy $H$. By reversibility from Hypothesis \ref{Eprimehyp}, $\dim W^s(0) = m$ and $\dim W^u(0) = m$.\\

In the next hypothesis, we assume that a symmetric homoclinic orbit solution exists to \eqref{genODE}.

\begin{hypothesis}\label{Qexistshyp}
A homoclinic orbit solution $Q(x) \in W^s(0) \cap W^u(0) \subset H^{-1}(0)$ exists to \eqref{genODE}. Furthermore, this solution is symmetric with respect to the reverser operator $R$ defined above by \eqref{reverserR2m}, i.e. $Q(-x) = R(Q(x))$.
\end{hypothesis}
 
Since we obtained \eqref{genODE} by putting \eqref{ODEonR} into a first order system in the standard way, $Q(x) = (q(x), q'(x), \dots, q^{(2m)}(x))^T$, where $q(x)$ is an even function and an exponentially localized solution to \eqref{ODEonR}.\\

We take a standard nondegeneracy condition regarding the homoclinic orbit $Q(x)$.

\begin{hypothesis}\label{nondegenhyp}
Let $Q(x)$ be the symmetric homoclinic orbit solution to \eqref{genODE} from Hypothesis \ref{Qexistshyp}. We take the non-degeneracy condition
\begin{equation}
T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^u(0) = \R Q'(0)
\end{equation}
\end{hypothesis}

Let $u^*(x)$ be an exponentially localized solution to \eqref{ODEonR}. The linearization of \eqref{ODEonR} about $u^*(x)$ is the eigenvalue problem

\begin{equation}\label{ODEeig}
E''(u^*(x)) v = \lambda v
\end{equation}

where $E''(u^*): H^{2m}(\R) \rightarrow H^{2m}(\R)$ is the Hessian of the energy and is self-adjoint. Since $E'(u)$ is translation invariant, it follows that $E'(u^*(x)) \partial_x u^*(x) = 0$.\\

We can write the eigenvalue problem \eqref{ODEeig} as the first-order system

\begin{equation}\label{ODEeig2}
V' = ( DF(U^*)V + \lambda B) V 
\end{equation}

where $B$ is the $2m \times 2m$ constant coefficient matrix

\begin{equation}
B = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  & 
\vdots &  & \vdots & \\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} 
\end{equation}

and 

\begin{equation}
DF(U^*) = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\
& &  & \ddots &  & & \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 1 \\
c_0 + f_0(x) & f_1(x) & c_2 + f_2(x) &
 \dots & c_{2m-2} + f_{2m-2}(x) & f_{2m-1}(x)
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The $c_i$ are constants which come from the linear part of $E'(u)$ and do not depend on $u^*$; by Hypothesis \ref{Eprimehyp},no odd-order derivatives are involved in the linear part of $E'(u)$, thus $c_j = 0$ for $j$ odd. The functions $f_i(x)$ decay exponentially to 0 since they are smooth functions of $u^*(x)$ and its derivatives. In addition, if $u^*(x)$ is an even function, $f_i(x)$ is an even function for $i$ even and an odd function for $i$ odd.\\

We make one additional assumption on the constant $c_0$, which we will need for the stability problem.

\begin{hypothesis}\label{c0nonzero}
For the constant $c_0$ in $DF(U^*)$, $c_0 \neq 0$.
\end{hypothesis}

This hypothesis is satisfied, for example, if \eqref{genPDE} is obtained from putting a nonlinear, dispersive PDE such as KdV5 into a moving reference frame with speed $c$. \\

$DF(U^*)$ is exponentially asymptotic to $DF(0)$, which has characteristic polynomial

\begin{equation}\label{charpolyDF0}
p_1(\nu) = \nu^{2m} - c_{2m-2} \nu^{2m-2} - \dots - c_2 \nu^2 - c_0
\end{equation}

By Hypothesis \ref{hypeqhyp}, $p_1(\nu)$ has roots at $\nu = \pm \alpha \pm i \beta$; for all other roots $\nu$ of $p_1(\nu)$ we have $|\text{Re }\nu| > \alpha$.\\

The variational and adjoint variational equations associated with \eqref{genODE} are

\begin{align}
\tilde{V}' = DF(Q(x))\tilde{V} \label{vareq1} \\
\tilde{W}' = -DF(Q(x))^* \tilde{W} \label{adjvareq1}
\end{align}

It follows from Hypothesis \ref{nondegenhyp} that $Q'(x)$ is the unique bounded solution to \eqref{vareq1} and that there exists a unique bounded solution $\Psi(x)$ to \eqref{adjvareq1}. It follows from Hypothesis \ref{Hhyp} that $\Psi(x) = \nabla H(Q(x))$. Since $E''(q)$ is self-adjoint, the $2m$-th component of $\Psi(x)$ is $q'(x)$.\\

% Finally, we decompose the tangent space at $Q(0)$ as 

% \begin{equation}
% \R^{2m} = \R \Psi(0) \oplus \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \oplus Y^-
% \end{equation}

% where

% \begin{align*}
% T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) &= \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \\
% T_{Q(0)}W^u(0) &= \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^- \\
% \end{align*}

% and $\Psi(0) \perp \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \oplus Y^-$.\\

We can now state the existence theorem for periodic multi-pulse solutions. A$n-$periodic solution to \eqref{genODE} is a periodic orbit $Q_{np}(x)$ which resembles $n$ copies of the primary pulse solution $Q(x)$. We will describe an $n-$periodic solution by $n$ lengths $X_0, \dots, X_{n-1}$, where the $n-1$ distances between the $n$ peaks are $2X_0, \dots 2X_{n_2}$, and $X_{n-1}$ is the distance from the left- and right-most peaks to the periodic boundary.

\begin{theorem}[Existence of $n$-periodic solutions]\label{perexist}
Assume Hypotheses \ref{Eprimehyp}, \ref{Hhyp}, \ref{hypeqhyp}, \ref{Qexistshyp}, and \ref{nondegenhyp}. Let $Q(x)$ be a transversely constructed, symmetric primary pulse solution to \eqref{genODE}.\\

Then there exists an a nonnegative integer $M$ and $K > 0$ such that the following holds. For any 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item integer $n \geq 2$ \\
\item integer $m \geq M$ \\
\item sequence of nonnegative integers $\{ m_0, \dots, m_{n-2} \}$, where at least one of them must be 0
\end{enumerate}

there exists a 1-parameter family of $n$-periodic solutions to \eqref{genODE} associated with $m$ and the set $\{ m_j \}$. This 1-parameter family is parameterized by the length $X_{n-1} \in [K, \infty)$.\\

The lengths $X_0, \dots, X_{n-2}$ are given by

\begin{equation}\label{Xi}
X_i = \frac{\pi}{2 \beta}m 
- \frac{1}{2 \alpha} \log(a_i(X_{n-1}, r_m)) + C
\end{equation}

where $C$ is a constant, $r_m = e^{-m \pi \alpha/\beta}$, and $a_i(X_{n-1}, r_m) \rightarrow e^{-m_i \pi \alpha/ \beta}$ as $(X_{n-1}, r_m) \rightarrow (\infty, 0)$. For large $X_{n-1}$ and $m$, the lengths $X_0, \dots, X_{n-2}$ are approximately

\begin{equation}\label{Xiapprox}
X_i = \frac{\pi}{2 \beta}(m + m_i) + C
\end{equation}

If $U(x)$ is such a solution, then $U(x)$ can be written piecewise for $i = 0, \dots, n-1$ as 

\begin{align}
U_i^-(x) &= Q^-(x; \beta_i^-) + V_i^-(x) && x \in [X_{i-1}, 0] \\
U_i^+(x) &= Q^+(x; \beta_i^+) + V_i^+(x) && x \in [0, X_i]
\end{align}

where the subscripts $i$ are taken $\mod n$. The functions $Q^\pm(x; \beta_i^\pm)$ are solutions to \eqref{genODE} with initial conditions $\beta_i^\pm$ in the stable/unstable manifold. For these terms, we have bounds

\begin{align*}
|Q^\pm(x; \beta_i^\pm)| \leq C (e^{-2 \alpha X_{i-1}} + e^{-2 \alpha X_i})e^{-\alpha |x|}
\end{align*} 

The remainder terms $V_i^\pm(x)$ have bounds

\begin{align}
|V_i^-(x)| &\leq C e^{-\alpha(X_{i-1} + x)}e^{-\alpha X_{i-1}} \\
|V_i^+(x)| &\leq C e^{-\alpha(X_i - x)}e^{-\alpha X_i} 
\end{align} 
\end{theorem}

For the family of $2-$periodic solutions, we have actually have found the complete bifurcation structure, which we can add as a theorem here.

\subsection{Stability Problem}

In the previous section, we have shown existence of periodic multi-pulse solutions to \eqref{genODE}, which yield equilibrium solutions to \eqref{genPDE}. We will now look at their linear stability. This involves finding the eigenvalues of \eqref{genPDE}. Let $u^*(x)$ be any exponentially localized equilibrium solution to \eqref{genPDE}. Substituting the standard linearization ansatz $u(x, t) = u^*(x) + \epsilon e^{\lambda t}v(x)$ into \eqref{genPDE} and keeping terms of order $\epsilon$, we obtain the PDE eigenvalue problem

\begin{equation}\label{PDEeig}
\partial_x E''(u^*(x)) v = \lambda v
\end{equation}

which is just \eqref{ODEeig} with a $\partial_x$ out front. From the previous section, $[\partial_x E''(u^*(x))] \partial_x u^*(x) = 0$. Let $U^*(x) = (u^*(x), \partial_x u^*(x), \dots, \partial_x^{2m}u^*(x))$. Then we can write \eqref{PDEeig} as the first order system 

\begin{equation}\label{PDEeig2}
V' = ( A(U^*)V + \lambda B)V 
\end{equation}

where $A(U^*)$ is the $(2m+1) \times (2m+1)$ matrix

\begin{equation}\label{DefA}
A(U^*) = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\
& & \ddots  \\
0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 1 \\
f_0'(x) & c_0 + f_0(x) + f_1'(x) & \dots & c_{2m-2} + f_{2m-2}(x) + f_{2m-1}' (x) & f_{2m-1}(x)
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

and $B$ is the $(2m +1) \times (2m+1)$ constant coefficient matrix

\begin{equation}\label{DefB}
B = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  & 
\vdots & & \vdots & \\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} 
\end{equation}

(We keep the notation $B$ for the matrix since it has exactly the same form as the matrix $B$ in the previous section.) The terms $c_i$ and $f_i(x)$ in the bottom row of $A(U^*)$ are the same as in those in the bottom row of $DF(U^*)$ from the previous section. Since $u^*(x)$ is exponentially localized, $A(U^*)$ is exponentially asymptotic to $A(0)$, which has characteristic polynomial

\begin{equation}\label{charpolyA0}
p_2(\nu) = -\nu^{2m+1} + c_{2m-2} \nu^{2m-1} + \dots + c_2 \nu^3 - c_0 \nu = \nu p_1(\nu)
\end{equation}

where $p_1(\nu)$ is the characteristic polynomial of $DF(0)$ from the previous section. Thus $A(0)$ has a simple eigenvalue at 0, and the rest of the eigenvalues of $A(0)$ are the same as those of $DF(0)$. Using Hypothesis \ref{hypeqhyp}, it follows that the spectrum of $A(0)$ contains $\{ 0, \pm \alpha \pm \beta i\}$, and for any other eigenvalue $\nu$ of $A(0)$, $|\text{Re }|\nu| > \alpha$. Since $A(0)$ is not hyperbolic, the results of San98 do not apply.\\

Let $W^s(0)$, $W^u(0)$, and $W^c(0)$ be the stable, unstable, and center manifolds of the equilibrium at 0. By reversibility from Hypothesis \ref{Eprimehyp}, $\dim W^s(0) = m$ and $\dim W^u(0) = m$. The center manifold $W^c(0)$ is one-dimensional.\\

Let $Q(x) = (q(x), \partial_x q(x), \dots, \partial_x^{2m} q(x))$, where $q(x)$ is the symmetric primary pulse solution from Hypothesis \ref{Qexistshyp}. (We do note that $Q(x) \in \R^{2m+1}$ here, so has one additional component compared to $Q(x)$ in the previous section; we keep the same notation for convenience since it represents the same equilibrium solution $q(x)$). \\

The variational and adjoint variational equations associated with \eqref{PDEeig2} are

\begin{align}
V' = A(Q) V \label{vareq2} \\
W' = -A(Q)^* W \label{adjvareq2}
\end{align}

$Q'(x)$ is an exponentially localized solution to \eqref{vareq2}. Since $Q(x)$ is exponentially localized, it cannot involve the center manifold $W^c(0)$, thus it must lie in the intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds. In particular, this implies that $\R Q'(0) \subset T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^u(0)$. From Hypothesis \ref{nondegenhyp}, these are actually equal, which we state in the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{nondegenlemma}
We have the nondegeneracy condition

\begin{equation}\label{nondegen2}
T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^u(0) = \R Q'(0)
\end{equation}

\begin{proof}
Since $Q(x)$ is a homoclinic orbit in the intersection of $W^u(0)$ and $W^s(0)$, $\R Q'(0) \subset T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^u(0)$. If the intersection were more than one-dimensional, there would exist another exponentially localized solution $V(x) = (v_1, \dots, v_{2m}, v_{2m+1})^T$ to \eqref{vareq2}. It follows that $\tilde{V}(x) = (v_1, \dots, v_{2m})^T$ would be an exponentially localized solution to \eqref{vareq1}, which contradicts Hypothesis \ref{nondegenhyp}.
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

Using the nondegeneracy condition, we can decompose the tangent spaces of the stable and unstable manifolds at $Q(0)$ as

\begin{align*}
T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) &= \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \\
T_{Q(0)}W^u(0) &= \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^- \\
\end{align*}

Let $V_0$ and $W_0$ be the eigenvectors of $A(Q)$ and $-A^*(Q)$ corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. From \eqref{DefA}, we can see that

\begin{align}
V_0 &= (-1/c_0, 0, 0, \dots, 0)^T \label{V0} \\
W_0 &= (-c_0, 0, -c_2, 0, -c_4, 0, \dots, 0, -c_{2m-2}, 0, 1)^T \label{W0}
\end{align}

where we have scaled $V_0$ so that $\langle V_0, W_0 \rangle = 1$. We have the following lemma regarding solutions to \eqref{vareq2} and \eqref{adjvareq2}.

\begin{lemma}\label{varadjsolutions}
We have the following solutions to the variational equation \eqref{vareq2} and adjoint variational equation \eqref{adjvareq2}.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]

\item There exists exactly two linearly independent, bounded solutions $\Psi(x)$ and $\Psi^c(x)$ to \eqref{adjvareq2}. $\Psi(x)$ is exponentially localized, i.e. $e^{\alpha |x|}\Psi(x)$ is bounded. For $\Psi^c(x)$,
	\begin{equation}
	\Psi^c(x) \rightarrow W_0 \text{ as }|x| \rightarrow \infty
	\end{equation}
For $\Psi(x)$, we have $\Psi(-x) = R \Psi(x)$, where $R$ is the standard reversor operator. In addition, $\Psi(0), \Psi^c(0) \perp \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \oplus Y^-$.

\item There exists a bounded solution $V_0(x)$ of \eqref{vareq2} such that 
\begin{equation}
V_0(x) \rightarrow V_0 \text{ as }|x| \rightarrow \infty
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The adjoint variational equation \eqref{adjvareq2} is the following equation written as a first order system
\begin{equation}\label{adj2}
[\partial_x E''(q) ]^* v(x) = -E''(q) \partial_x v(x) = 0,
\end{equation}
which has exponentially decaying solution $q(x)$. Thus we have an exponentially localized solution $\Psi(x)$ to \eqref{adjvareq2} which has $q(x)$ as its $(m+1)$-th component. Since $q(x)$ is an even function, the functions $f_j(x)$ from \eqref{DefA} are even for $j$ even and odd for $j$ odd. Thus, from the form of $A(Q)$, $\Psi(-x) = R \Psi(x)$, where $R$ is the standard reversor operator.

\item Equation \eqref{adj2} also has the constant solution 1 as a solution. Thus \eqref{adjvareq2} has a solution $\Psi^c(x)$ which has $1$ as its $(m+1)$-th component. This solution has the form

\[
\Psi^c(x) = \begin{pmatrix}
-c_0 + g_1(x) \\ g_2(x) \\
-c_2 + g_3(x) \\ g_4(x) \\
\vdots \\
-c_{2m-2} + g_{2m-1}(x) \\ g_{2m}(x) \\ 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]

where the functions $g_j(x)$ are linear combinations of the functions $f_j(x)$ from \eqref{DefA} and their derivatives and are thus exponentially localized. It follows that $\Psi^c(x) \rightarrow W_0$ as $|x| \rightarrow \infty$, where $W_0$ is given by \eqref{W0}.

\item For any solutions $V(x)$ and $W(x)$ to the variational equation \eqref{vareq2} and the adjoint variational equation \eqref{adjvareq2}, $\langle V(x), W(x) \rangle$ is constant in $x$. Since solutions $V(x)$ to \eqref{vareq2} with initial conditions in $\R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \oplus Y^-$ decay exponentially to 0 at the appropriate end, any bounded solution to \eqref{adjvareq2} must be perpendicular to $\R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \oplus Y^-$ at $x = 0$, thus this holds for $\Psi(0)$ and $\Psi^c(0)$. Since $\R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \oplus Y^-$ is a $(2m-1)-$dimensional subspace of $\R^{2m+1}$ and we have found two linearly independent, bounded solutions of \eqref{adjvareq2}, there can be no others.

\item Recall that $\dim W^{s/u}(0) = m$ and $\dim W^c(0) = 1$, thus $\dim W^{cs}(0) = m + 1$, and $\dim W^{cu}(0) = m + 1$. $\Psi(0) \perp T_{Q(0)}W^{cs}(0) + T_{Q(0)}W^{cu}(0)$, so $\dim T_{Q(0)}W^{cs}(0) + T_{Q(0)}W^{cu}(0) \leq 2m$. This implies, by a dimension-counting argument, that $\dim T_{Q(0)}W^{cs}(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^{cu}(0) = 2$. Since $\dim T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) = 1$ by Lemma \ref{nondegenlemma}, we conclude that there exists $Y_0 \in T_{Q(0)}W^{cs}(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^{cu}(0)$ which is linearly independent from $Q'(0)$, and $Y^0 \notin T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^s(0)$.

\item $V_0(x)$ be the unique solution to the variational equation \eqref{vareq2} with initial condition $Y_0$ at $x = 0$. Since $Y^0 \notin T_{Q(0)}W^s(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^s(0)$, $V(0)$ cannot decay to 0 at $\pm \infty$. Thus $Y_0$ must be in the center component of $T_{Q(0)}W^{cs}(0) \cap T_{Q(0)}W^{cu}(0)$, and so it must remain bounded. In particular, $V(x) \rightarrow V^\pm$ as $x \rightarrow \pm \infty$.

\item Using the Gap Lemma, we can find solutions $V^\pm(x)$ to the variational equation \eqref{vareq2} on $\R^\pm$ such that
\[
V^\pm(x) = V_0 + \mathcal{O}(e^{-(\alpha - \epsilon)|x|})
\]
for some $\epsilon > 0$. (Note that since the eigenvalue is 0 in the Gap Lemma, there is no term involving it.) Since $V^+(-x)$ is another solution on $\R^-$ with the same property, by uniqueness from the Gap Lemma we conclude that $V^+(-x) = V^-(x)$. In particular, this implies that $V^+(0) = V^-(0)$.

\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

Using Lemma \ref{nondegenlemma} and Lemma \ref{varadjsolutions}, we can decompose $\R^{2m+1}$ as  

\begin{equation}
\R^{2m+1} = S \oplus \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \oplus Y^-
\end{equation}

where $S = \spn\{ \Psi(0), \Psi^c(0) \}$, and $S \perp \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+ \oplus Y^-$ by Lemma \ref{varadjsolutions}.\\

Finally, we will look at the Melnikov integrals relevant to the problem. The lowest order Melnikov integral is

\begin{equation}\label{M1}
M_1 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \langle \Psi(x), B Q'(x) \rangle =
\int_{-\infty}^\infty q(x) \: \partial_x q(x) = 0
\end{equation}

since $q(x)$ is an even function and the last component of $\Psi(x)$ is $q(x)$. Recall that 

\[
\ker [\partial_x E''(q)]^* = \ker(-E''(q) \partial_x) = 
\text{span}\{ q, 1 \}
\]

Since $\langle \partial_x q, q \rangle = 0$ (from above) and $\langle \partial_x q, 1 \rangle = 0$ (since $q$ is an even function), $q \perp \ker [\partial_x E''(q)]^*$. Thus, by the Fredholm alternative, there exists a function $t(x) \in H^{2m}(\R)$ such that $[ \partial_x E''(q) ]t(x) = \partial_x q(x)$. Let $T(x) = (t(x), \partial_x t(x), \dots, \partial_x^{2m}(x))^T$. Then $T(x)$ solves the equation

\begin{equation}\label{eqforT}
T' = A(Q)T + B Q'
\end{equation}

We take the following hypothesis regarding the higher order Melnikov integral.

\begin{hypothesis}\label{Melnikov2hyp}
We have the following Melnikov-like expression
\begin{equation}\label{M2}
M_2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \langle \Psi(x), B T(x) \rangle dx =
\int_{-\infty}^\infty q(x) t(x) dx \neq 0
\end{equation}
\end{hypothesis}

Let $q_{np}(x)$ be a periodic $n-$pulse solution constructed with lengths $X_0, \dots, X_{n-1}$ according to Theorem \ref{perexist}. By a similar analysis, we have

\begin{align*}
\partial_x E''(q_{np}) (\partial_x q_{np}(x)) &= 0 \\
\partial_x E''(q_{np}) t_{np}(x) &= q_{np}(x) \\
\end{align*}

We are interested in the eigenvalues of \eqref{PDEeig} for equilibrium solution $u^*(x) = q_{np}(x)$. To do this, we use Lin's method to construct an eigenfunction $V(x)$ as a perturbation of a piecewise linear combination of $Q'(x)$ and $T(x)$. For $X_m = \min\{X_0, \dots, X_{n-1} \}$ sufficiently large and $\lambda$ sufficiently small, Lin's method constructs an unique function function $V(x)$ which solves \eqref{PDEeig2}. This function is continuous except for $n$ jumps, so it is only an eigenfunction if all of these jumps are 0. Lin's method gives a formula for those jump conditions; finding the eigenvalues $\lambda$ amounts to solving the $n$ jump conditions.\\

In order to set up the problem, we rewrite the PDE eigenvalue problem \eqref{PDEeig2} as

\begin{equation}\label{PDEeig3}
V' = A(U^*(x); \lambda)V 
\end{equation} 

where $A(U^*(x); \lambda) = A(U^*) + \lambda B$. For $\lambda = 0$, the asymptotic matrix $A(0; 0)$ has a eigenvalue at 0. By Hypothesis \ref{hypeqhyp}, this eigenvalue at 0 is simple and located a distance $\sqrt{\alpha^2 + \beta^2}$ from the nearest other eigenvalues. Using the IFT and Hypothesis \ref{c0nonzero}, for sufficiently small $\lambda$, $A(0; \lambda)$ has a simple eigenvalue $\nu(\lambda)$ near 0. By the IFT and the reversibility hypothesis , this eigenvalue is given by

\begin{equation}\label{nulambda}
\nu(\lambda) = -\frac{1}{c_0} \lambda + \mathcal{O}(|\lambda|^3)
\end{equation}

and has following properties

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\nu(-\lambda) = -\nu(\lambda)$, i.e. $\nu(\lambda)$ is an odd function 
\item If $\lambda$ is pure imaginary, $\nu(\lambda)$ is also pure imaginary
\end{enumerate}

We can now state the stability theorem for periodic multi-pulse solutions. 

\begin{theorem}\label{blockmatrixtheorem}
There exists a $\delta > 0$ with the following property. Assume the same hypotheses as in Theorem \ref{perexist}, and let $q_{np}(x)$ be a periodic $n-$pulse solution constructed with lengths $X_0, \dots, X_{n-1}$ according to Theorem \ref{perexist}, where $X_m = \min\{ X_0, \dots X_{n-1}\}$ and $e^{-\alpha X_m} < \delta$. Then there exists a bounded, nonzero solution $V$ of \eqref{PDEeig} for $|\lambda| < \delta$ if and only if 

\begin{equation}\label{blockeq}
E(\lambda) = \det
\begin{pmatrix}
K(\lambda) + C_1 K(\lambda) + K_1(\lambda) & D_1 \\
C_2 K(\lambda) + K_2(\lambda) & A - \lambda^2 MI + D_2
\end{pmatrix} = 0
\end{equation}

where 

\begin{enumerate}

\item The matrix $K(\lambda)$ is given by

\begin{equation}
K(\lambda) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{-\nu(\lambda)X_1} & & & & & -e^{\nu(\lambda)X_0} \\
-e^{\nu(\lambda)X_1} & e^{-\nu(\lambda)X_2} \\
& -e^{\nu(\lambda)X_2} & e^{-\nu(\lambda)X_3} \\
& \ddots & \ddots & &&  \\
& & & & -e^{\nu(\lambda)X_{n-1}} & e^{-\nu(\lambda)X_0} 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

where $\nu(\lambda)$ is the small eigenvalue of the asymptotic matrix $A(0; \lambda)$ defined in \eqref{nulambda}.

\item $A$ is the symmetric matrix

\begin{align}\label{Asymm}
A &= \begin{pmatrix}
-a_0 -a_1 & a_0 + a_1 \\
a_0 + a_1 & -a_0 - a_1
\end{pmatrix} && n = 2 \\
A &= \begin{pmatrix}
-a_{n-1} - a_0 & a_0 & & &  & a_{n-1}\\
a_0 & -a_0 - a_1 &  a_1 \\
& a_1 & -a_1 - a_2 &  a_2 \\
& \ddots & \ddots & \ddots \\
a_{n-1} & & & & a_{n-2} & -a_{n-2} - a_{n-1} \\
\end{pmatrix} && n > 2 \nonumber
\end{align}

where

\begin{align*}
a_i &= \langle \Psi(X_i), Q'(-X_i) \rangle \\
\end{align*}

$\Psi(x)$ is the exponentially localized solution to the adjoint variational equation \eqref{adjvareq2} defined in Lemma \ref{varadjsolutions}. $Q(x) = (q(x), \partial_x q(x), \dots, \partial_x^{2m}q(x))$, where $q(x)$ is the symmetric primary pulse solution from Hypothesis \ref{Qexistshyp}.\\

\item $K_1(\lambda)$ and $K_2(\lambda)$ are small perturbations of $K(\lambda)$, where the nonzero terms of $K(\lambda)$ are perturbed by $\mathcal{O}(|\lambda| + e^{-\alpha X_m})$.

\item The remainder terms are analytic in $\lambda$ and have uniform bounds

\begin{align*}
C_1, C_2 &= \mathcal{O}(e^{-\tilde{\alpha}X_m})(|\lambda| + e^{-\alpha X_m})) \\
D_1 &= \mathcal{O}((|\lambda| + e^{-\tilde{\alpha} X_m})(|\lambda| + e^{-\alpha X_m})) \\
D_2 &= \mathcal{O}((|\lambda| + e^{-\tilde{\alpha} X_m})(|\lambda| + e^{-\alpha X_m})^2)
\end{align*}

\item $M$ is the higher order Melnikov integral

\begin{align*}
M &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty \Psi(y) t(y) dy \\
\end{align*}

where $t(y)$ is the generalized kernel eigenfunction for $\partial_x E''(q)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

We can use this theorem to solve for the eigenvalues $\lambda$ of \eqref{PDEeig}. In order to do that, we need to make a few additional hypotheses.\\

First, we note that the matrix $A$ from Theorem \ref{blockmatrixtheorem} is symmetric, thus its eigenvalues are real. $A$ has an eigenvalues of 0 corresponding to eigenvector $(1, 1, \dots, 1)^T$. We will hypothesize that the eigenvalues of $A$ distinct. 

\begin{hypothesis}\label{eigAdistinct}
The eigenvalues of $A$ are given by $(0, \mu_1, \dots, \mu_{n-1})$, all of which are distinct.
\end{hypothesis}

This is not true in general. For example, if $n \geq 3$ and all the terms $a_i$ in $A$ are identical, $A$ is a circulant matrix and it is not hard to show that $A$ will have eigenvalues of algebraic multiplicity 2. It might be possible to impose a condition that guarantees distinct eigenvalues. If so, we will hypothesize that instead. Since the problem $(A - \lambda I)v = 0$ is a Sturm-Liouville difference equation, that's a good place to look for such a result.\\

Let $X = X_0 + X_1 + \dots + X_{n-1}$, which is half the length of the domain. We note the following regarding the matrices $A - \lambda^2 I$ and $K(\lambda)$, which are the leading order terms in \eqref{blockeq}.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The matrix $A - \lambda^2 M I$ is singular at $\lambda = 0$ (algebraic multiplicity 2) and at the $2n-2$ points $\lambda = \pm \sqrt{\mu_1/M}, \dots, \pm \sqrt{\mu_{n-1}/M}$.

	\item The matrix $K(\lambda)$ is singular at $\lambda = \pm \lambda(X,k)$, where
	\begin{align}\label{lambdaXk}
	\lambda(X,k)
		&= -c_0 \frac{k \pi i }{X} + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{k}{X}\right)^2 
	\end{align} 
	and $\lambda(X, 0) = 0$.
\end{enumerate}  

For the nonzero eigenvalues of \eqref{PDEeig}, we expect to have $2m-2$ interaction eigenvalues, which occur near $\lambda = \pm \sqrt{\mu_j/M}$ ($j = 1, \dots, m-1$), as well as pairs of ``essential spectrum'' eigenvalues, which occur near $\lambda = \pm c_0 \frac{k \pi i }{X}$. For the analysis to work, we need to ensure that these singular points do not get too close.\\

We can now state the following theorem, in which we locate and count the eigenvalues of \eqref{PDEeig}. Before we do that, we recall how the periodic $n-$pulse $q_{np}(x)$ is constructed.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Choose $n$ (the number of pulses) 
	\item Choose a sequence of nonnegative integers $m_0, \dots, m_{n-2}$, with the restriction that at least one of them must be 0. 
	\item Let
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $b^* = \exp \left( -\frac{\alpha}{\beta} \arctan \frac{\beta}{\alpha} \right)$
			\item $b_j^* = \exp \left(-\frac{m_j \pi \alpha}{\beta} \right) b^*$, $j = 1, \dots, n-2$.
			\item $b_\text{min} = \min\{ b_0^*, \dots, b_{n-2}^* \}$
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Then for any $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $r_0 > 0$ such that
		\begin{itemize}
			\item For each $r_m < r_0$, where 
				\[ r_m = \exp\left(-\frac{m \pi \alpha}{\beta} \right)  \]
			\item There exists a unique 1-paramater family of periodic $n-$pulse solutions, paramaterized by the periodic length parameter $b_{n-1}$, where
			     \[ b_{n-1} \in (0, b_\text{min} - \epsilon] \]
			\item The remaining length parameters are given by $b_j(b_{n-1}, r_m)$, where $b_j(b_{n-1}, r)$ is smooth in $b_{n-1}$ and $r$
				\[ b_j(b_{n-1}, r) \rightarrow \exp \left(-\frac{m_j \pi \alpha}{\beta} \right) \text{ as } (b_{n-1}, r) \rightarrow (0,0) \]
			\item The actual lengths $X_j$, $j = 0, \dots, n-1$, are determined from $r_m$ and the $b_j$ using the formula
			\begin{align*}
				X_j &= -\frac{1}{2\alpha}\log(b_j(b_{n-1}, r) r) - \frac{\phi}{2 \beta} 
			\end{align*}
			where $\phi$ is a constant.
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

We also recall that

\begin{itemize}
	\item $K(\lambda)$ is singular at $\lambda = \pm \lambda^K(X,n)$, where
	\begin{align*}
		\lambda^K(X,n) &= -c_0 \frac{n \pi i }{X} + \mathcal{O}(n/X)^3 \\
	\end{align*}
	\item $A - \lambda^2 M I$ is singular at $\{ 0, \pm \sqrt{\mu_1(b_{n-1}, r_m)}, \dots \pm \sqrt{\mu_1(b_{n-1}, r_m)} \}$, where the $\mu_j(b_{n-1}, r_m)$ are smooth in $b_{n-1}$ and $r$.
\end{itemize}

With this, we can state the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
Let $\delta > 0$ be defined as in Theorem \ref{perexist} and Theorem \ref{blockmatrixtheorem} and let $q_{np}(x)$ be a periodic $n-$pulse solution constructed as described above.\\

Then the following are true.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]

\item $\partial_x q_{np}(x)$ is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue 0, and $t_{np}(x)$ is its generalized eigenfunction with eigenvalue 0. This Jordan chain is of length 2.

\item There exist $r_2 \leq r_0$ and $\tilde{b}_2 > 0$ such that the following is true. For any $r_m < r_2$ and $b_{n-1} < \tilde{b}_2$, as long as the points $\lambda^K(X,n)$ and $\pm \sqrt{\mu_1(b_{n-1}, r_m)}$ are more than $\epsilon/X$ apart, where $\epsilon = r_m^{1/2}$, there exist $2n - 2$ pairs of interaction eigenvalues given by

\begin{align*}
\lambda &= \pm \lambda^{\text{int}}_j(b_{n-1}, r) && j = 1, \dots, n-1
\end{align*}

These interaction eigenvalues pairs are at most $\mathcal{O}(r^{1/2})$, are either real or purely imaginary, and are close to $\pm \sqrt{\mu_j^0 / M} = \pm \sqrt{\mu_j(0, 0)}$. The number of pairs which are real and purely imaginary is completely determined by the parity of the integers $m_j$; which one is which depends on the sign the Melnikov integral $M$.

\item There exist $r_3 \leq r_2$ and $\tilde{b}_3 < \tilde{b}_2$ such that the following is true. For any $r_m < r_3$ and $b_{n-1} < \tilde{b}_3$, as long as the points $\lambda^K(X,n)$ and $\sqrt{\mu_1(b_{n-1}, r_m)}$ are more than $\epsilon/X$ apart, where this time $\epsilon = r_m^{(3n-2)/6(n+3)}$, for sufficiently small $k/X$, $k \neq 0$, there exist pairs of purely imaginary ``essential spectrum'' eigenvalues, which are given by $\lambda = \pm \lambda^{ess}(X, k; r)$, where

\begin{equation}\label{essspeceigs}
\lambda^{ess}(X, k; r_m) = -c_0 \frac{k \pi i}{X} + \mathcal{O}\left(r_m\right)
\end{equation}

The remainder term cannot move these off of the imaginary axis.

\item For a radius $\tilde{\delta}$ which may be slightly smaller than $\delta$ and for the same values of $r_m$ and $b_{n-1}$ as above, there are exactly $2n + 2k + 1$ eigenvalues inside $B(0, \tilde{\delta}) \subset \C$ (counting multiplicity), where $n$ is the number of pulses in the multi-pulse, and $k$ is a positive integer depending on $X$. From Hamiltonian symmetry, there is an additional eigenvalue at 0, thus 0 has algebraic multiplicity 3. There are no eigenvalues inside $B(0, \tilde{\delta}) \subset \C$ other than those which have already been discussed.

\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

% \subsection{KdV5}

% For KdV5, a primary pulse solution is known to exist (Chug2007, among others), so Hypothesis \ref{transverseQ} is satisfied. For $c > 1/4$, Hypothesis \ref{hypeqhyp} is satisfied. Finally, for KdV5, \eqref{genODE} is Hamiltonian, so Hypothesis \ref{Hhyp} is satisfied. Thus, Theorem \ref{perexist} holds, and $n-$periodic solutions exist.\\

% We assume Hypothesis \ref{nondegen} holds for KdV5. The adjoint variational equation has two solutions, $\Psi(x)$ and $\Psi^c(x)$, which are given by

% \begin{equation}\label{KdV5psi}
% \Psi(x) = \begin{pmatrix}
% q^{(4)}(x) - q''(x) + (-2q(x) + c)q(x)\\
% -q^{(3)}(x) + q'(x) \\
% q''(x) - q(x) \\
% -q'(x) \\
% q(x)
% \end{pmatrix}
% \end{equation}

% and

% \begin{align}\label{KdV5psic}
% \Psi^c(x) = (c - 2 q(x), 0, -1, 0, 1)^T
% \end{align}

% where $q(x)$ is the primary pulse solution (as a real-valued function). These satisfy Hypothesis \ref{adjsolutions}. Finally, the higher order Melnikov integral is given by

% \begin{align*}
% M &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty q(x) \partial_c q(x) dx \\
% \end{align*}

% We assume that $M_2 \neq 0$, which is suggested by numerics.
