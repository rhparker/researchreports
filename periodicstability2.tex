Here we look at the variational problem / adjoint variational equation for the linearization of KdV5 about an equilbrium solution $u^*$. This linearization is

\begin{equation}
L(u^*) = \partial_x H(u^*) = \partial_x ( \partial_x^4 - \partial_x^2 + c - 2 u^*)
\end{equation}

The variational / adjoint variational equations for the linearization about the primary pulse solution $q(x)$ are given by

\begin{align}
V' = A(q(x))V \label{vareq} \\
W' = -A(q(x))^*W \label{adjvareq}
\end{align}

where

\begin{align}
A(u^*(x)) = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
2u^*_x(x) & 2u^*(x) - c & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

If we consider $A(0)$ for $c > 1/4$ we have eigenvalues $\nu = \{ 0, \pm \alpha \pm \beta i\}$, where $\alpha, \beta > 0$. The equilibrium at 0 is not hyperbolic, so we cannot directly apply the results of San98. The equilibrium at 0 has 2-dimensional stable/unstable manifolds, and a 1-dimensional center manifold. Let $W^{s/u/c}(0)$ be these manifolds.\\

Let $q(x)$ be the primary pulse (homoclinic orbit) solution, whose existence is known. Since its existence comes from the 4th order (integrated) problem, for which the equilibrim at 0 is hyperbolic, we will still make the same nondegeneracy assumption as before, i.e. we will assume the stable and unstable manifolds have a 1-dimensional intersection.

\begin{hypothesis}\label{nondegen}
\[
T_{Q(0)} W^u(0) \cap T_{Q(0)} W_s(0) = \R Q'(0)
\]
\end{hypothesis}

where $Q(x)$ is the single pulse solution on $\R$, written as a vector-valued function in $R^5$ in the usual way. We cannot conclude from Hypothesis \ref{nondegen} that $Q'(x)$ is the unique bounded solution to the variational equation \eqref{vareq}.\\

Now, we look at the adjoint variational equation. Since $L(q)^* = (\partial_x H(q))^* = -H(q) \partial_x$, we can easily see that there are two bounded solutions to this: $q(x)$ and the constant function $1$. Since we are on a periodic domain, the constant function is periodic and in $L^2$, so we have to consider it here.\\

Thus there are two bounded solutions $\Psi(x) = \nabla H(q(x))$ and $\Psi_c(x)$ of \eqref{adjvareq}, corresponding to $q(x)$ and 1.\\

Next, as in San98, we will decompose the tangent space at $Q(0)$. First, we define $Y^-$ and $Y^+$ as the ``rest of'' the tangent space of the unstable/stable manifolds.

\begin{align*}
T_{Q(0)} W^u(0) &= \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^- \\
T_{Q(0)} W^s(0) &= \R Q'(0) \oplus Y^+
\end{align*}

Counting dimensions and using Hypothesis \ref{nondegen}, $\R Q'(0) \oplus Y^- \oplus Y^+$ is ``missing'' two dimensions, so we want to fill that in.\\

Before we do that, we need to look at how the variational equation works. The idea, as far as I know, is that that the variational equation evolves the tangent spaces of the stable/unstable/center manifolds $W^{s/u/c}(0)$. I have not found a good reference on this but it seems to make sense. In any case, let $\Phi(x, y)$ be the evolution operator for the variational equation \eqref{vareq} on $\R$. This, of course, means that $\Phi(x, 0)Y$ is the unique solution to \eqref{vareq} for any IC $Y$given at $x = 0$. In this case, there are no perturbations or parameters. Then we should have the following.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $Q'(x)$ is a solution to \eqref{vareq}, so we know what $U(x) = \Phi(x)Q'(0)$ is.
	\item For an IC $Y \in Y^-$ and $x \leq 0$, $|\Phi(x, 0) Y| \leq C e^{\alpha x}$. The decay rate $\alpha$ is the known decay rate of the unstable/stable manifold of the original equation.
	\item For an IC $Y \in Y^+$ and $x \geq 0$, $|\Phi(x, 0) Y| \leq C e^{-\alpha x}$. 
\end{enumerate}

Recall that we showed (somewhere) that

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $\langle V(x), W(x) \rangle$ is constant in $x$ for any solutions $V(x)$ to \eqref{vareq} and $W(x)$ to \eqref{adjvareq}.
\item $\Phi(x, y)^*$ is the evolution operator for \eqref{adjvareq}.
\end{enumerate}

Since the inner product is continuous in $x$, it follows that if as $x \rightarrow \infty$ (or $-\infty$), if either $V(x)$ or $W(x)$ decays exponentially and the other one is bounded (it could decay too of course), then $\langle V(0), W(0) \rangle = 0$, i.e. $V(0) \perp W(0)$. Choosing the appropriate things for $V(x)$ and either $\Psi(x)$ or $\Psi_c(x)$ for $W(x)$ we conclude that

\begin{align*}
\Psi(0) &\perp Q'(0) \oplus Y^- \oplus Y^+ \\
\Psi_c(0) &\perp Q'(0) \oplus Y^- \oplus Y^+
\end{align*}

Since $\Psi(0)$ and $\Psi_c(0)$ are linearly independent, we conclude that 

\[
\R^{2m + 1} = Q'(0) \oplus Y^- \oplus Y^+ \oplus \Psi(0) \oplus \Psi_c(0) 
\]

(this is $\R^5$ for KdV5). If we want to ignore $Y_c(0)$, we can take

\[
\R^{2m + 1} = Q'(0) \oplus Y^- \oplus Y^+ \oplus \Psi(0) \oplus Y^0 
\]

where $Y^0$ is perpendicular to the other 4 things.\\

Now we use the Gap Lemma from Zum2018. Taking $\lambda = 0$ (and the parameters $\beta_i^\pm = 0$), we can find solutions $V^\pm(x)$ and $W^\pm(x)$ on $\R^\pm$ which are given by

\begin{align*}
V^\pm(x) = V_0 + \mathcal{O}(e^{-(\alpha - \epsilon)|x|}|V_0|) \\
W^\pm(x) = W_0 + \mathcal{O}(e^{-(\alpha - \epsilon)|x|}|W_0|)
\end{align*}

where the decay is in the appropriate direction. $V_0$ and $W_0$ are the eigenvectors of $A(0)$ and $A(0)^*$ corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. In this case, we have $V_0 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0)$ and $W_0 = (c, 0, -1, 0, 1)$. $\epsilon > 0$ is arbitrary. Since the inner product $\langle V^\pm(x), W^\pm(x) \rangle$ is constant and the inner product is continuous in both arguments, from the above expressions we have for all appropriate $x$


\[
\langle V^\pm(x), W^\pm(x) \rangle = \langle V_0, W_0 \rangle = c \neq 0
\]

In particular, $\langle V^\pm(0), W^\pm(0) \rangle \neq 0$. We would like to know where $V^\pm(0)$ and $W^\pm(0)$ fit into the overall scheme above. 

Since $V^+(x)$ is bounded and $\Psi(x)$ decays exponentially, we have $V^+(0) \perp \Psi(0)$. Obviously we cannot say the same thing for $\Psi_c(0)$ since $\Psi_c(x)$ does not decay exponentially.\\

Let $y^+ \in Y^+$. Then since $\Phi(x, 0)y^+$ is an exponentially decaying solution to \eqref{vareq} on $\R^+$ and $W^+(x)$ is a bounded solution to \eqref{adjvareq} on $\R^+$, we conclude as above that $W^+(0) \perp Y^+$. We get the same result if we take $x^+ \in \R Q'(0)$, thus we conclude that $W^+(0) \perp \R Q'(0)$. Doing the same thing on $R^-$, we get $W^-(0) \perp Y^-$ and $W^-(0) \perp \R Q'(0)$.\\

Next, we look at an initial condition $y^- \in Y^-$. Taking the inner product of a solution starting at $y^-$ with $W^+(0)$, we have for $x \geq 0$

\begin{align*}
\langle y^-, W^+(0) \rangle &= \langle \Phi(0, x) \Phi(x, 0) y^-, W^+(0) \rangle \\
&= \langle \Phi(x, 0) y^-, \Phi(x, 0)^* W^+(0) \rangle \\
&= \langle \Phi(x, 0) y^-, W^+(x) \rangle 
\end{align*}

The LHS of this is constant. As we take the $x \rightarrow 0$, the RHS blows up, since $\Phi(x, 0) y^-$ evolves forward along the unstable manifold (thus increases exponentially in magnitude), and $W^+(x)$ stays bounded. The only way around this is for $\langle y^-, W^+(0) \rangle = 0$, thus we must have $Y^- \perp W^+(0)$. Similarly we can show that $Y^+ \perp W^-(0)$.\\ 

Thus we have shown

\begin{align*}
W^+(0) \perp Y^+ \oplus Y^- \oplus \R Q'(0) \\
W^+(0) \perp Y^+ \oplus Y^- \oplus \R Q'(0)
\end{align*}

This means that 

\begin{align*}
W^+(0), W^-(0) \in \R \Psi(0) \oplus \R \Psi_c(0) \\
\end{align*}

Using this direct sum, we can write $W^+(0)$ uniquely as

\[
W^+(0) = z \Psi(0) + z_c \Psi_c(0)
\]

Evolving this forward, since the evolution operator is linear, we have 

\[
W^+(x) = z \Psi(x) + z_c \Psi_c(x)
\]

Taking $x \rightarrow \infty$ and recalling that $\Psi(x)$ decays exponentially to 0, we have

\[
z_c \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \Psi_c(x) = \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} W^+(x) = W_0
\]

Since we can scale eigenfunctions any way we want, we can scale 










So since it has no component in $\Psi(0)$, let's write $V^+(0)$ as

\[
V^+(0) = y^0 + y^- + y^+ + x^+
\]

where $y^0 \in Y^0, y^- \in Y^+, y^- \in Y^-, x^+ \in \R Q'(0)$. We can pick whatever we want as an IC and get a solution to \eqref{vareq}, so let's take the IC $V^+(0) - y^+ - x^+ = y^0 + y^-$. By linearity,

\begin{align*}
\Phi(x, 0)( V^+(0) - y^+ - x ) &= \Phi(x, 0)V^+(0) - \Phi(x, 0) y^+ - \Phi(x, 0) x^+ \\
&= V_0 + \mathcal{O}(e^{-(\alpha - \epsilon)x}|V_0|) + \mathcal{O}(e^{-\alpha x}|y^+| + 
\mathcal{O}(e^{-\alpha x}|x^+|) \\
&= V_0 + \mathcal{O}(e^{-(\alpha - \epsilon)x})
\end{align*}

So with this IC, we still have a solution with the property we want. Thus for our solution $V^+(x)$ we can take $V^+(0) \in Y^- \oplus Y^0$. We can do the same thing with $V^-(x)$, so we can take $V^-(0) \in Y^- \oplus Y^0$. Thus we have solutions to \eqref{vareq}

\begin{align*}
V^+(x) &= V_0 + \mathcal{O}(e^{-(\alpha - \epsilon)x}) && V^+(0) \in Y^0 \oplus Y^-, x \geq 0 \\
V^-(x) &= V_0 + \mathcal{O}(e^{(\alpha - \epsilon)x}) && V^-(0) \in Y^0 \oplus Y^+, x \geq 0
\end{align*}
